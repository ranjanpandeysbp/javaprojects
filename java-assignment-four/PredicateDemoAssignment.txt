The PredicateDemo class is a Java class that demonstrates the use of a functional interface called Predicate.
The class has a single public method named drivingCheck that takes an integer inputAge as input and returns
a boolean value that indicates whether the age is above or below 18.


Create a class PredicateDemo which contains a method drivingCheck.
The drivingCheck method takes an integer value named inputAge as input
and returns a boolean value that indicates whether the age is above or below 18.

A Predicate variable named drivingAllowedOrNot is created using a lambda expression that takes an integer value as input
and returns a boolean value indicating whether the age is greater than or equal to 18.
The test method of the Predicate interface is used to test whether the inputAge is greater than or equal to 18.


public class PredicateDemo {

    public boolean drivingCheck(Integer inputAge){

        boolean isDrivingAllowed = false;

        Predicate<Integer> drivingAllowedOrNot = age -> age >= 18;

        isDrivingAllowed = drivingAllowedOrNot.test(inputAge);
        if(isDrivingAllowed){
            System.out.println("You are allowed to Drive");
        }else {
            System.out.println("You are not allowed to Drive");
        }

        return isDrivingAllowed;
    }

Create a Main class and instantiate the PredicateDemo class.
Use the Scanner class to take the age as input from the user. Once the user enters the age call the drivingCheck
method to check if its allowed for driving.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PredicateDemo pd = new PredicateDemo();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your age");
        pd.drivingCheck(scanner.nextInt());
    }
}
