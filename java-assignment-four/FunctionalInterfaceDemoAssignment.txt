In this example, a class named FunctionalInterfaceDemo that demonstrates the use of a
functional interface called Circle. The class has a single public method named areaCircle
that takes a double value as the radius of a circle and returns the area of that circle as a double.

Create an interface Circle and a method declaration for area which takes radius and return double.
Annotate with @FunctionalInterface.

@FunctionalInterface
interface Circle {
    double area(double radius);
}

Create a new Java class named FunctionalInterfaceDemo.Inside the class, create a method areaCircle
which takes radius as input and return type as double.
Give the method definition of the Circle interface in the class. Here we are trying to calculate the
area of the circle which is 3.14(pi) * r* r.
Call the method defined in interface with radius.

public class FunctionalInterfaceDemo {
    public double areaCircle(double radiusInput){
        Circle c = r -> 3.14 * r * r;
        return c.area(radiusInput);
    }
}


Create a Main class and instantiate the object.
Call the method and pass radius and see the area of circle returned as result.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FunctionalInterfaceDemo functionalInterfaceDemo = new FunctionalInterfaceDemo();
        double areaOfCircle = functionalInterfaceDemo.areaCircle(5);
        System.out.println("Area of circle is " + areaOfCircle);

    }
}
