Constructor chaining
In this exercise you will write an application that uses constructor chaining.
The application will set the variables of an object using constructor chaining.

Create a class ConstructorChaining and add two class attributes.
1. name with datatype String
2. age with datatype int

Create the getters for the attributes.

public class ConstructorChaining {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public int getAge() {
            return age;
        }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

}

Now create a parametrized constructor which sets only the name.

public class ConstructorChaining {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public ConstructorChaining(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
}

Now create another parametrized constructor which takes two parameters name and age.
Here only set the age to the class attribute and set the name using the constructor defined previously.

public class ConstructorChaining {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public ConstructorChaining(String name) {
            this.name = name;
    }

    public ConstructorChaining(String name, int age) {
            this(name);
            this.age = age;
    }
}

Notice how the constructor is called using this(name) from another constructor.
This is constructor chaining where one constructor is called from another constructor.

Now create a Main class. Instantiate the object for ConstructorChaining passing name and age as parameters.
Print the name and age.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Constructor chaining sets the name and age parameter");
        ConstructorChaining constructorChaining = new ConstructorChaining("John", 25);
        System.out.println("Name is : " + constructorChaining.getName());
        System.out.println("Age is : " + constructorChaining.getAge());
    }
}
